			<a href="http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~iac879/wp/guide-arts.pdf"> A User’s Guide to Approximate Randomization Tests in Regressions with a Small Number of Clusters</a>
		</h5>
	    	With Ivan Canay, Deborah Kim and Azeem Shaikh. <br>

		This paper provides a user’s guide to the general theory of approximate randomization tests developed in Canay et al. (2017a) when specialized to linear regressions with clustered data. Such regressions include settings in which the data is naturally grouped into clusters, such as villages or repeated observations over time on individual units, as well as settings with weak temporal dependence, in which pseudo-clusters may be formed using blocks of consecutive observations. An important feature of the methodology is that it applies to settings in which the number of clusters is small – even as small as five. We provide a step-by-step algorithmic description of how to implement the test and construct confidence intervals for the quantity of interest. We additionally articulate the main requirements underlying the test, emphasizing in particular common pitfalls that researchers may encounter. Finally, we illustrate the use of the methodology with two applications that further elucidate these points: one to a linear regression with clustered data based on Meng et al. (2015) and a second to a linear regression with temporally dependent data based on Munyo and Rossi (2015). The required software to replicate these empirical exercises and to aid researchers wishing to employ the methods elsewhere is provided in both R and Stata

			<a href="#">Some Finite Sample Properties of the Sign Test</a> 
		</h5>
		This paper contains two finite-sample results about the sign test. First, we show that the sign test is unbiased against two-sided alternatives even when observations are not identically distributed. Second, we provide simple theoretical counterexamples to show that correlation that is unaccounted for leads to size distortion and over-rejection. Our results have implication for practitioners, who are increasingly employing randomization tests for inference.
