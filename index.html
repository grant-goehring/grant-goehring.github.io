			This paper studies the impact of career concerns on technological change by analyzing the adoption of digital cinematography in the US motion picture industry. This setting allows us to collect rich data on the adoption of this new technology at the project-level (i.e., movie) as well as on the career of the main decision maker (i.e., director). We find that early career directors played a leading role in the adoption of digital technology and that this effect appears to be explained by career concerns, rather than alternative motives we consider and analyze. Technological savvy also plays a role.

In the late 1800s, local leaders in the United States established red-light districts to confine prostitution within cities. Progressive Era reformers began lobbying against this policy, arguing they made health and crime worse, which precipitated the closure of these districts in the 1910s. This paper assesses the public health consequences of closing red-light districts using city-level mortality statistics. I find that infant mortality increased by approximately 7% after closure. Congenital syphilis was a significant problem during the period, and this finding is consistent with increased syphilis transmission. Overall, the results suggest the public health concerns raised by reformers were overstated.

The purchase and sale of sex is heavily regulated or banned in most jurisdictions, but our understanding of the consequences of regulation remains limited. We study a set of laws passed in Britain in the 1860s known as the Contagious Disease Acts (CDAs) that were aimed at reducing the spread of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). These regulations mandated sex workers undergo routine medical examinations for STIs and gave police the authority to detain women that tested positive for up to nine months. The first part of our analysis shows that the CDAs led to substantial public health improvements. However, these regulations were repealed in 1886. The second part examines the causes of this repeal. Our results show that the success of public health regulations depend not only on the policy’s effectiveness, but also on the perceived fairness of the distribution of its costs. These results provide a new perspective on the impact of regulating the sex trade while also improving our understanding of a policy that played a key role in the women’s rights movement in the U.K.

		  <p>
			This paper provides a user’s guide to the general theory of approximate randomization tests developed in Canay et al. (2017a) when specialized to linear regressions with clustered data. An important feature of the methodology is that it applies to settings in which the number of clusters is small – even as small as five. We provide a step-by-step algorithmic description of how to implement the test and construct confidence intervals for the parameter of interest. In doing so, we additionally present three novel results concerning the methodology: we show that the method admits an equivalent implementation based on weighted scores; we show the test and confidence intervals are invariant to whether the test statistic is studentized or not; and we prove convexity of the confidence intervals for scalar parameters. We also articulate the main requirements underlying the test, emphasizing in particular common pitfalls that researchers may encounter.
