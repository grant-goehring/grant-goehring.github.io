			<a href="#">Some Finite Sample Properties of the Sign Test</a> 
		</h5>
		This paper contains two finite-sample results about the sign test. First, we show that the sign test is unbiased against two-sided alternatives even when observations are not identically distributed. Second, we provide simple theoretical counterexamples to show that correlation that is unaccounted for leads to size distortion and over-rejection. Our results have implication for practitioners, who are increasingly employing randomization tests for inference.
