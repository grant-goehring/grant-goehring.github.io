			<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.05503.pdf">Panel Data with Unknown Clusters</a> 
		</h5>
		Clustered standard errors and approximate randomization tests are popular inference methods that allow for dependence within observations. However, they require researchers to know the cluster structure ex ante. We propose a procedure to help researchers discover clusters in panel data. Our method is based on thresholding an estimated long-run variance-covariance matrix and requires the panel to be large in the time dimension, but imposes no lower bound on the number of units. We show that our procedure recovers the true clusters with high probability with no assumptions on the cluster structure. The estimated clusters are independently of interest, but they can also be used in the approximate randomization tests or with conventional cluster-robust covariance estimators. The resulting procedures control size and have good power.

		This paper provides a user’s guide to the general theory of approximate randomization tests developed in Canay et al. (2017a) when specialized to linear regressions with clustered data. Such regressions include settings in which the data is naturally grouped into clusters, such as villages or repeated observations over time on individual units, as well as settings with weak temporal dependence, in which pseudo-clusters may be formed using blocks of consecutive observations. An important feature of the methodology is that it applies to settings in which the number of clusters is small – even as small as five. We provide a step-by-step algorithmic description of how to implement the test and construct confidence intervals for the quantity of interest.

			<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.01008.pdf">A Modified Randomization Test for the Level of Clustering</a> 
		</h5>
		Suppose a researcher observes individuals within a county within a state. Given concerns about correlation across individuals, at which level should they cluster their observations for inference? This paper proposes a modified randomization test as a robustness check for their chosen specification in a linear regression setting. Existing tests require either the number of states or number of counties to be large. Our method is designed for settings with few states and few counties. While the method is conservative, it has competitive power in settings that may be relevant to empirical work.

			<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.01412.pdf">Some Finite Sample Properties of the Sign Test</a> 
		</h5>
		This paper contains two finite-sample results about the sign test. First, we show that the sign test is unbiased against two-sided alternatives even when observations are not identically distributed. Second, we provide simple theoretical counterexamples to show that correlation that is unaccounted for leads to size distortion and over-rejection. Our results have implication for practitioners, who are increasingly employing randomization tests for inference.
