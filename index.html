			The Neyman Allocation and its conditional counterpart are used in many papers on experiment design, which typically assume that researchers have access to large pilot studies. This may not be realistic. To understand the properties of the Neyman Allocation with small pilots, we study its behavior in a novel asymptotic framework for two-wave experiments in which the pilot size is assumed to be fixed while the main wave sample size grows. Our analysis shows that the Neyman Allocation can lead to estimates of the ATE with higher asymptotic variance than with (non-adaptive) balanced randomization, particularly when the population is relatively homoskedastic. We also provide a series of empirical examples showing that the Neyman Allocation may perform poorly for values of homoskedasticity that are relevant for researchers. Our results suggest caution when employing experiment design methods involving the Neyman Allocation estimated from a small pilot study.

			This paper provides a user’s guide to the general theory of approximate randomization tests developed in Canay et al. (2017a) when specialized to linear regressions with clustered data. An important feature of the methodology is that it applies to settings in which the number of clusters is small – even as small as five. We provide a step-by-step algorithmic description of how to implement the test and construct confidence intervals for the parameter of interest. In doing so, we additionally present three novel results concerning the methodology: we show that the method admits an equivalent implementation based on weighted scores; we show the test and confidence intervals are invariant to whether the test statistic is studentized or not; and we prove convexity of the confidence intervals for scalar parameters. We also articulate the main requirements underlying the test, emphasizing in particular common pitfalls that researchers may encounter.
